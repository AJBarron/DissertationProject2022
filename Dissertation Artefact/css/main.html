                    <div>• By using this site, Facebook will build a personal profile about you. This profile can be used to predict your sexuality, political orientation or even IQ with a 98% accuracy rate (Kavianpour, Tamimi & Shanmugam, 2019).
                    </div>
                    <div>• Facebook keeps track of your location and the people around you at all times - it is doing this in order to more efficiently make money from you (Huo et al., 2021).
                    </div>
                    <div>• Third parties, companies that operate on Facebook, can collect your data often without consent from you or Facebook (Mansour, 2016).
                    </div>
                    <div>• Facebook has previously allowed politicians to advertise to specific individuals in order to influence their voting patterns (Reisach, 2021).
                    </div>
                    <div>• Facebook allowed the British consulting firm Cambridge Analytica to harvest the personal information of 87 million users (Hinds, Williams & Joinson, 2020).</div>
                    <div>• Facebook has repeatedly misused your data and abused your personal privacy. Do you still trust them?</div>
